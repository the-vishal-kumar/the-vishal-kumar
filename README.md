### 👋 Hello, World!

I'm [**Vishal Kumar**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/the-vishal-kumar/), a **Lead Software Development Engineer** with 9+ years of experience designing backend architectures, building scalable systems, and leading high-impact engineering teams.

By day, I lead product and infrastructure efforts at [CapGrid](https://capgrid.in). By night, I write technical blogs at [funGyaan.com](https://funGyaan.com), explore SaaS ideas, and contribute to open source. My goal is to build products that outlive me.
